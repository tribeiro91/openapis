# OpenAPI catalog

Hello and welcome to my OpenAPI catalog!

Here I am storing all the OpenAPI files that I've created for study reasons.

## What is OpenAPI?

OpenAPI is a specification language to design *Application Programming Interface (API)* where you can design the API in `JSON` or `YAML` formats.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to get to know OpenAPI, I recommend you to access [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/) platform.

## OpenAPI catalog

This repository is divided into two folders: `pt-br` (Portuguese) and `en` (English), where each one will store OpenAPI file according to its language.

Hereafter, there is the list of the OpenAPIs stored:

### Portuguese - [pt-br]

- 24/03/2024 - API de Portadores
